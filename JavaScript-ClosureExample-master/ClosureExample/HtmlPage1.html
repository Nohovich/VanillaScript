<!-- A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer function’s variables in addition to it's own variables and global variables.
     In simple terms a closure is function inside a function.
    These functions, that is the inner and outer functions could be named functions or anonymous functions.-->
<script type="text/javascript">
    // incrementClickCount = the inner anonymous function
    // incrementClickCount will keep track on clickCount value even after the function was finished

    var incrementClickCount =
        // by putting  the function inside the (function) we are making it possible for it to run only one time
        (
            function () {
                // the value we want to increment
                var clickCount = 0;

                // inner anonymous function
                // only this part can happened multiple times

                    return ++clickCount;
